  summary: During my senior years at Univeristy of Puget Sound, I was actively involved in the student radio station, KUPS, where my friend and I had a weekly show called "Holy Heartbreak!". The show dedicated each hour show to the progress of early Blues into Soul and finally making its way into R&B and Disco, concentrating on songs about the troubles of the heart. By alternating each week from male to female artists, the show was able to give listners both perspectives of love and heartbreak. #helped facilitate our student organization communications through website maintenance, writing for our campus publication, and graphic design of related materials.
